# Hi everyone, I'm Chloe

Former NOC Engineer I, but learning as much as I can about backend development to land in the field.

My hometown is San Diego, CA.

:mortar_board: Exploring and learning new tech stacks:
- Backend development through [boot.dev](https://boot.dev)
- Virtualization (KVM/QEMU, Hyper-V, etc.)
- Containerization (Docker, Podman, LXC/LXD/LXCFS)

:rocket: Open for project collaboration.
