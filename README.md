# Hi everyone, I'm Chloe

I'm a NOC Engineer I at a networking company, but learning as much as I can about Back-end Development to land in the field.

My hometown is San Diego, CA.

:mortar_board: Exploring and learning new tech stacks:
- Full-Stack Engineering (HTML/CSS/JS/Python and PostgreSQL)
- Virtualization (KVM/QEMU, Hyper-V, etc.)
- Containerization (Docker, Podman, LXC/LXD/LXCFS)

:rocket: Open for project collaboration.
